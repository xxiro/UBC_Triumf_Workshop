******** Ferromagnetic chain ********

The goals of this exercise are:
1. Get comfortable with submitting problems to the QPU and visualize the solutions using 
    the problem inspector
2. Explore the probabilistic nature of the solutions
3. Explore the physical qubit parameters (local h biases and inter-qubit couplings J) in a
    linear chain

Suggested exercises:
1. What do you see if you run the problem multiple times? 
    What about if you increase the number of reads? 
2. Make an anti-ferromagnetic chain by changing the sign of fm_coupler_strength
3. What happens if you add a linear bias (h) on one end of the chain? This can be 
    done in either the ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic case. How does the 
    strength of that bias affect your results? (for example, try h = 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0. 
    What happens to the number of solutions in each state and the energies?)
4. What happens if you multiply all of the h and J biases by the same factor (2x, 5x, 10x)?
    Do your solutions change? What about their energies? 
5. What happens if you ferromagnetically couple the chain, and impose opposite 
    h bias on each end of the chain? What if those biases have different magnitude?
