******** FM and AFM Bonus ********

Now that you've played around with the h's and J's, let's look at some annealing properties. By default
the will anneal for 20 us and will follow the schedule shown here:
https://docs.dwavesys.com/docs/latest/c_fd_as.html#anneal-schedule-variations

Leap allows you to change the length of time you anneal for and the shape of the energy waveform (or the 
anneal schedule). We support annealing times in the range of 1 us to 2 ms. 

The anneal schedule allows you to modify the way the QPU progresses through the anneal. The anneal trajectory is 
represented by s, where s=0 is the beginning of the anneal and s=1 is the end. By changing the time at which the QPU
ends up in a certain part of the anneal (s), you can change the shape of the energy waveform. For example, you can 
introduce a pause or finish the anneal really quickly part way through (quench). 

The anneal schedule is specified by a piecewise linear set of (time, s) coordinates. The default anneal schedule is:
    default_anneal_schedule = [(0.0, 0.0), (20.0, 1)]

(Note that the segments in the anneal schedule are linear in anneal fraction s, but since the energy scale is not linear in 
s, the anneal schedule also does not 
    
Let's say you want to change the anneal schedule so that in 15 us you are 40% of the way through the anneal. Then you
want to pause for 5 us and then progress through the remaining 60% of the anneal in another 10 us. This is how you would 
do it:
    new_anneal_schedule = [(0.0, 0.0), (15, 0.4), (20, 0.4), (30, 1)]

Investigate
    1. What happens to your FM or AFM chain when you lengthen or shorten the annealing time?
    2. What happens when you change the anneal schedule?
    3. What kinds of problems do you think would be more susceptible to changes in the anneal schedule?
