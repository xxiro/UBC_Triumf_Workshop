Problem: Partition the set from the Maximum Cut exercise slides so that the partition cuts through a maximum number
of edges

'''

# 1. Import packages
from dwave.system import DWaveSampler, EmbeddingComposite
from collections import defaultdict
import networkx as nx
import dwave.inspector as inspector

# 2. Set up the problem
# Create empty graph
G = nx.Graph()

# Add edges to the graph (also adds nodes)
G.add_edges_from([('a', 'b'), ('b', 'c'), ('b', 'd'), ('c', 'd'), ('c', 'f'), ('d', 'f'), ('d', 'e'), ('e', 'f')])
print(G.edges)

# ------- Set up our QUBO dictionary -------
# Initialize our Q matrix
Q = defaultdict(int)

# Update Q matrix for every edge in the graph
for i, j in G.edges:
    Q[(i,i)]+= -1
    Q[(j,j)]+= -1
    Q[(i,j)]+= 2

# 3. Instantiate a solver
sampler = EmbeddingComposite(DWaveSampler(solver={'qpu': True}))

# 4. Solve the problem
sampleset = sampler.sample_qubo(Q, chain_strength=8, num_reads=100)

inspector.show(sampleset)

# 5. Interpret the results - print the results with the lowest energy
print(sampleset.lowest())
